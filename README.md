To Do list

This is a very simple and easy to use "To do list", in which you can add and delete, your daily tasks.
tried my best to keep the interface as simple as possible for not only users, but also for fellow devs who want to use it and develop it further.

How to use: 
1. Open two command prompts(works in VS Code)
2. Navigate to To-Do (Using cd command)
3. In the first prompt type "ng serve" (without quotation marks)
4. In the second one, type npm run server to run db.json
5. Refresh the page, task(s) should show up now
