 To Do List


This is a very simple and easy to use "To do list", in which you can add and delete, your daily tasks.
tried my best to keep the interface as simple as possible for not only users, but also for fellow devs who want to use it and develop it further.

NOTE: All Inputs are of type 'text(string in TypeScript)'.
NOTE2: I have used JSON Server, which makes a fake JSON Server without any coding or knowledge of database.
Note3: The reference I've used is provided at the bottom.
